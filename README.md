# test-inventory-system

A sample application to show off my coding skills.

Developed in Eclipse using Apache Tomcat and MySQL.

I used a very simple schema of one table to store the garments.  I did not include any log-in tables since this was just a demo.  The sql to create the table, as well as seed test data, can be found in the file "master/database create and seed.sql".
